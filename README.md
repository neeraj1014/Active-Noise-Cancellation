# Active Noise Cancellation

## Introduction
Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) is a technique used to reduce unwanted background noise by generating anti-noise signals. This project implements ANC using MATLAB.

## Features
- Real-time noise cancellation
- Adaptive filtering algorithms
- Signal processing techniques for noise suppression
- Supports multiple audio input sources

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/neeraj1014/Active-Noise-Cancellation.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open MATLAB and run the main script.

## Usage
1. Open MATLAB.
2. Load the project files.
3. Run the main script.
4. Adjust noise cancellation parameters in the script if necessary.

## Technologies Used
- MATLAB
- Signal Processing Toolbox
